  							<h1>Customer FAQ</h1>
  							
  							<h3>Go me! I am a customer who wants to use boxPAY. Now what?</h3>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">How do I complete a transaction?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">It depends on what country you are in, but generally one of two ways. When you see the boxPAY widget and you want to pay for something, click on it and you will be prompted to complete the transaction in one of two ways: <br/> <br/>
  							
  							<strong>Option 1</strong> - Enter your mobile phone number and get a text message with a pin code confirming your transaction, which you then enter back into the widget to access your purchase.  <br/> <br/>
  							<strong>Option 2</strong> - Text a word or phrase to the short code provided, and get a text message with a pin code confirming your transaction, which you then enter back into the widget to access your purchase.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Where does the charge go?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">If you pay monthly, the charge will go on your mobile carrier bill. If you are a Pay As You Go customer, it is deducted from your pre-paid balance.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Do I need a username or password?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">No, you do not need to create a username or remember any passwords! You also donâ€™t need to enter any personal information other than your phone number.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Do I need a credit card?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">No, you do not need a credit card to use boxPAY. All you need is a mobile phone.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">What kinds of phones does boxPAY work with?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">boxPAY works with any phone that can receive an SMS text message in any of the regions we operate in. Please see our <a href="#">Reach</a>.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Can I use boxPAY if I have a Pay As You Go plan?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">Yes, if you are a Pay As You Go customer, the charge is deducted from your credit.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">I tried to pay entering my phone number, but never received my confirmation message...</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">This may have happened for several reasons. Either you do not have enough credit to make the purchase, or your carrier has not authorized you to receive premium SMS messages. You may also have SMS barring in place. Please check your phone settings and contact your carrier service provider for more information.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Is there customer support at boxPAY?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">Yes, email <a href="mailto:customercare@boxpay.com">customercare@boxpay.com</a> with any issues.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">Is boxPAY safe and secure?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">Yes, because all you are entering is your mobile phone number, there is no risk of fraud or other security issues. And since you have to enter a PIN to confirm the purchase, there is no way someone can use your mobile phone without your authorization.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">What countries does boxPAY work in?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">Please see our <a href="#">Reach</a> for details.</p>
