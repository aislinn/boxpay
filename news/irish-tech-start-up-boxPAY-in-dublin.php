  					<h4>Company Offers SMS-Based Mobile Payment Platform; Is Hiring New Employees in the Growing Mobile Technology Sector</h4>
  					
  					<p><strong>Dublin, Ireland; June 13, 2011</strong> â€“ boxPAY Ltd, a new mobile technology firm created by brothers Gavin and Iain McConnon, has introduced an SMS-based mobile payment platform for web merchants and game developers. The company was created in response to a need in the marketplace from online merchants who are losing potential sales over requirements for users to fill out credit card forms in order to make in-app or in-game purchases.</p>
  					
  					<p>The brothers have over 10 years experience in mobile billing, so creating the new boxPAY platform was a natural progression. Especially because of the boom in online gaming and application development, merchants are looking for additional ways to create revenue from their products. "We had all the experience and tools necessary to make this company a reality" said Gavin McConnon, "There is a fair amount of competition out there, but our relationships with aggregators and carriers in over 50 countries will be the key to our success."</p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY is hiring for a variety of positions, including Account Managers, Developers, Accountants, Database Administrators and Carrier Relationship Managers. Iain McConnon explained "Dublin has fast become a European hub for tech-central companies. There is an illusion out there that there are no jobs available anywhere, but technology, especially mobile technology, is an incredibly fast-growing sector. We are hiring constantly."</p>
