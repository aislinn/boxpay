  					<h2>boxPAY Mobile Payments Announces Subscription Service Available in Australia</h2>
  					
  					<h4>boxPAY has released a new subscription service for online merchants who wish to repeat bill customers in Australia</h4>
  					
  					<p><strong>Dublin, Ireland; December 19, 2011</strong> â€“ boxPAY, a mobile payments provider for web merchants, game developers, and other e-businesses, has released a new subscription service for online merchants who wish to repeat bill customers in Australia. With this feature, boxPAY merchants can offer their customers the option to opt-in to make automated payments through their mobile phone. </p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY utilizes SMS and direct carrier billing, and offers merchants the ability to charge customers for digital content through a mobile phone instead of a credit card. The platform can be integrated into a merchant website from boxPAY.com, a self-service website, in minutes. Using boxPAY, customers can make a purchase on a merchant website with no pre-registration required, and the charge is added to their mobile bill or deducted from a prepaid balance. With the subscription billing service now available in Australia, customers can opt-in to a subscription so their phone is automatically billed. How often a customer is charged will depend on the billing frequency of the merchant subscription program. For example, if a customer wants to opt-in for a weekly subscription for a digital edition of a newspaper for $2 AUD, each week their mobile phone would receive a text message confirming this transaction. </p>
  					
  					<p>Iain McConnon, Co-Founder of boxPAY, said "Subscription mobile payments are a service that was previously unavailable in the mobile billing industry. This opportunity is a way for web merchants to use mobile billing to engage customers on a repeat basis, instead of just one-time purchases. Additionally, boxPAY will provide a full API developers guide and technical support to any merchant who wishes to integrate subscription billing." </p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY is offering merchants the opportunity to sign-up for subscription billing in Australia at no charge by clicking here, or visiting <a href="http://www.boxpay.com">www.boxpay.com</a>.  	</p>
