  					<h4>boxPAY Mobile Billing Offers Press and Media New Platform to Monetize Digital Content; Charge Readers for Information Through Mobile Phones</h4>
  					
  					<p><strong>Dublin, Ireland; November 8, 2011</strong> – boxPAY Ltd., a provider of SMS-based mobile billing services to web merchants, is opening up their global billing platform to press and media as a new way to charge readers for digital content. By implementing the boxPAY payment system on a website, a company can charge readers for specific content that a customer is interested in purchasing, as opposed to requiring a full subscription. The customer pays a small amount and this charge is applied to their mobile phone bill, or deducted from their pre-paid balance. The boxPAY billing service is now available in over 35 countries worldwide.</p>
  					
  					<p>"A challenge news and media outlets often face is figuring out how to make money from their content outside of subscription services and advertising. Readers often encounter payment walls that restrict further access to a story or content, and require readers to commit to a lengthy subscription. This interrupts the user experience and can result in lost readership and revenue" says Co-Founder Gavin McConnon.</p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY works by providing a company with billing code that produces a simple payment box on their website. When a reader wishes to gain one-time access to premium content, the payment box prompts them to send a text message to complete the purchase. The transaction is complete in seconds, and content is available immediately. No lengthy forms or additional payment screens are necessary.</p>
  					
  					<p>Iain McConnon, boxPAY’s Co-Founder, expanded "We have created a solution for media companies to charge one time, small amounts for a story, e-book, or other content. This creates a new revenue stream for press and media companies, enabling them to monetize customers who do not have access to credit cards. Companies using boxPAY will see a large increase in the number of transactions completed versus using traditional billing methods."</p>
  					
  					<p>Any web merchant can register at no cost to use this service on <a href="http://boxPAY.com">boxPAY.com</a></p>
