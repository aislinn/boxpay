  					<h4>Service Allows Developers to Monetize TV Apps with No Registration or Credit Card</h4>
  					
  					<p><strong>Los Angeles; May 31, 2012</strong> – Smart TV apps are quickly growing in popularity: Market intelligence service In-Stat predicts that by 2016, 100 million households will use hybrid (Smart TV and Internet) services. But accessing paid content via Smart TV apps can be a hassle if it requires online registration and a credit card number. boxPAY, an innovative mobile payment provider currently serving web merchants, game developers and e-businesses in more than 60 countries, has the solution with a new Smart TV mobile payment service. boxPAY’s Smart TV billing allows consumers to purchase Smart TV apps, or make in-app payments, and charge it to their mobile phone account – with no registration or credit card numbers needed.</p>
  					
  					<p>The company will demonstrate the newly developed Smart TV service at the upcoming E3 at the Los Angeles Convention Center June 5-7, 2012, at booth #2858. With the boxPAY payments software development kit (SDK), television manufacturers and Smart TV app developers can quickly and easily integrate the payment option. This allows merchants to offer a payment option to potential customers who either do not have credit cards or are reluctant to go through a lengthy registration and transaction process for purchases.</p>
  					
  					<p>Instead, customers can choose to make a mobile payment, and boxPAY uses carrier billing to verify the transaction and add the cost of the Smart TV app to the customer’s mobile phone bill or prepaid balance. This can significantly extend the appeal of Smart TV apps by giving potential customers who do not use credit cards a purchase option. Making the purchase process quick and easy for consumers can also improve app offer response rates.</p>
  					
  					<p>"Smart TV apps are becoming hugely popular," said Iain McConnon, Co-Founder of boxPAY. "boxPAY makes it easy for TV manufacturers and TV app developers to generate better responses rates with an in-app mobile payment option that enables instant buying. boxPAY also provides a comprehensive API development guide and technical support to ensure a smooth implementation."</p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY are looking for Smart TV manufacturers and app developers to partner with on this newly developed service at the E3, booth #2858. Find out more about boxPAY and its innovative mobile payment solutions by visiting www.boxpay.com.</p>
