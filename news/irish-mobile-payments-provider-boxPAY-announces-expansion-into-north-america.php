  					<h2>Irish Mobile Payments Provider boxPAY Announces Expansion into North America</h2>
		
  					<h4>Rapidly growing tech start-up boxPAY opens office in San Francisco, announces billing services now available in the US and Canada.</h4>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY, a mobile payments provider for web merchants, game developers, and other e-businesses, has announced the opening of their new North American base in San Francisco, California. The office is in place to manage US and Canadian-based web merchants who are looking to use the boxPAY product to bill in 40 + countries all over the world. Company Co-Founders Gavin and Iain McConnon are onsite for the launch and are in the process of expanding the new team there. The Bay-Area office opening coincides with the announcement that boxPAY is now also offering billing services in the US and Canada to their many existing merchants around the world.</p>
  					
  					<p>Co-Founder Gavin McConnon said, "The move to North America was crucial to boxPAY's global expansion because of the significant amount of cellular subscribers in Canada and the US. We needed to offer our merchants from all over the globe access to these 350 million+ customers, especially because of the fact that mobile users here are comfortable with mobile payments." boxPAY's technology provides merchants the ability to charge customers for digital content through a mobile phone instead of a credit card. The platform can be integrated into a merchant website from boxPAY.com, a self-service website, in minutes. Using the mobile billing service, customers can make a purchase on a merchant website with no pre-registration required, and the charge is added to their mobile bill or deducted from a prepaid balance.</p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY is offering SMS payments in both the US and Canada, as well as direct carrier payments through connections to mobile operators in the US. Co-Founder Iain McConnon said, "We have negotiated especially favourable payment terms with connection providers in these regions to ensure our merchant base gets the best payouts across the industry. With our connections in the US and Canada, this brings the number of countries boxPAY is available in to over 40. With our eye on Asia next, we hope to be in over 60 countries by Q3."</p>
  					
  					<p>boxPAY is endorsed and supported by Enterprise Ireland, the government agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector in Ireland. boxPAY are directing all business development inquires to <a href="mailto:contact@boxpay.com">contact@boxpay.com</a>.</p>
