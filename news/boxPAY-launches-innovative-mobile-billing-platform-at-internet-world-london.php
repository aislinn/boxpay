  					<h2>boxPAY Launches Innovative Mobile Billing Platform at Internet World London</h2>
		
  					<p><strong>Dublin, Ireland; May 9 2011</strong> — Boxpay - an innovative Irish mobile payment start up - announced today that it is officially opening their billing platform to web based merchants. The product will be showcased at Internet World in London (May 9 – 11, 2011).</p>
  					
  					<p>Boxpay is a mobile payment service. It provides web merchants, game or application developers, social platforms, and premium listing services with a very efficient, secure, and low resistance mobile payment option. Boxpay combines SMS and web technologies to allow consumers to easily pay online with their mobile. With eight months in development, the Boxpay team is very excited to showcase the product for the first time.</p>
  					
  					<p>Co-Founder and Investor Gavin McConnon said "We have been involved in mobile payments for over 10 years and have adapted our technology to suit industry trends over time. With billions of dollars being generated now and with the industry growth expectations being so strong the decision to invest was simple".</p>
  					
  					<p>"Boxpay shortens the life cycle and makes online purchases simple and to the point. With no credit cards or long forms to fill out Boxpay essentially helps merchants convert more users into paying customers" said Kyle Hitchcox - Business Development Manager. "What’s really great about Boxpay is that merchants can access more regions than traditional billing methods, and bill users who are unbanked or don’t have access to credit cards".</p>
  					
  					<p>Shane Connolly - Chief Technical Officer, said that "Boxpay is developer focused. The platform leverages our very efficient high volume SMS billing platform and in depth reporting to bring a sophisticated micropayment system to the masses. At Boxpay we are constantly striving for added functionality, better performance, speed, simple integration and more detailed reporting."</p>
  					
  					<p>You can meet the Boxpay team at Internet World booth E6080. A presentation on the opportunity is scheduled for 1:40 PM Thursday May 12th in the Solutions Theatre.</p>
