  							<p>boxPAY Limited, having its registered office and trading office at Level's 3 &amp; 4 The Malting Tower, Clanwilliam Terrace, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2, Ireland ("We") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with our <a href="terms-of-use.html">terms of use</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, user IP addresses browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.</li>
  							
  							</ul>
  							
  							<h4>2. IP ADDRESSES</h4>
  							
  							<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
  							</p>
  							
  							<h4>3. COOKIES</h4>
  							
  							<p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.</p>
  							
  							
  							<h4>4. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
  							
  							<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
