  							<h3>Introduction to boxPAY</h3>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">What is boxPAY?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">boxPAY is a mobile payment processing solution. Our technology allows web merchants to charge customers for virtual goods and currencies to their mobile phone bill in over 60+ countries around the world. And we are adding more every day!</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">How do mobile payments work?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">Mobile payments are processed through a consumer’s mobile phone and the charge is added to the monthly bill, or deducted from credit on pay-as-you-go plans. Someone who wants to make a purchase using boxPAY simply selects the boxPAY logo as a payment method in the web browser, game, or application they are using, enters their phone number, and replies to a text message. It’s that simple! There are no forms to fill out and no extra navigating necessary. Transactions take less than 10 seconds.</p>
  							
  							<h4 class="faq-q">What kinds of companies do you work with?</h4>
  							<p class="faq-a">The boxPAY biz model works best with virtual goods. Social networks, online communities, web games and applications, dating and classified sites and digital content monetization are just some of the areas we specialize in. If you offer virtual goods, content, currency or services, we want to work with you!</p>

  							 <h3>Where to Begin? Using Mobile Payments</h3> 	
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">Why do I need a mobile payment option? My customers can already pay by credit card!</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">Statistics show that many consumers don’t have access to credit cards or bank accounts, especially young people and people in emerging markets like South America and Africa. But almost everyone has a mobile device! For those who do have credit cards, they often don’t want to go through the hassle of filling out time consuming forms online. Your customers are looking for a faster, more secure way to pay! By offering boxPAY in conjunction with your other payment options, your conversion rate will drastically increase, meaning more transactions for you.</p>
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">What is a conversion rate?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">A conversion rate is the percentage of customers that begin a transaction for a product you are offering, and then actually go through with purchasing the product. The mobile billing industry standard has a 60-70% conversion rate, or transaction completion. The conversion rate for credit card usage for virtual goods is much lower, around 5-15%. So by using boxPAY you can significantly increase the number of transactions you administer.</p>
  							 
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">What countries does boxPAY work in and with which mobile carriers?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">We offer mobile billing options in over 60+ countries, and in most countries we have 100% carrier coverage, giving you access to the entire wireless population in that region. This means that no matter what cellular network your customer is on, they can use boxPAY. Check out our <a href="#">Reach</a> page to get all the details.</p>
  							 
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">Can I request a country to bill my customers in that you do not currently offer?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">We have relationships with over 200 carriers from all over the world, but are always looking to expand. Let us know if there is a particular country you want to do business in and we will do our best to make it happen. Just email <a href="mailto:contact@boxpay.com">contact@boxpay.com</a>.</p>
  							 
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">What if I am selling physical goods?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">Service carriers take a moderate percentage of mobile transactions. Because of this, and the cost of raw materials, the payout from a transaction would not be enough to make a profit on a physical good. The amount of money carriers take from a transaction is expected to lower in the next few years. It has already happened Germany, Austria, and the USA. When this becomes widespread, mobile payments will be useful for physical goods as well.</p>
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">How do I get started using boxPAY?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">It’s easy! Just visit boxpay.com home page from any web browser, and click “Register Now” in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Just fill out a little bit of information about your business, and the Set-Up Wizard will take it from there.</p>
  							 
  							 
  							 <h4 class="faq-q">Is there a lengthy approval process?</h4>
  							 <p class="faq-a">No! As long as you are following our terms and conditions within each country you can begin billing straight away in most regions.</p>

  							 <h3>Getting wiggy with it. Technical Integration.</h3>
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">How do I integrate boxPAY into my application or website?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">The boxPAY advantage means merchants have two implementation models to choose from: (1) Set Up Wizard or (2) through our API. Implementation can be as simple as embedding code in your site or by working with our engineers in creating highly custom applications. Either way boxPAY will guide you through the process.</p>
  							  
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">Is it technically difficult to integrate boxPAY?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">Not at all. Our Set-Up Wizard is designed for people who don’t necessarily have a background in programming. To integrate all you have to do is cut and paste Javascript from the merchant area and paste it into your site or service. We take care of the rest. Of course, we also love working with developers on technical integration into our API.</p>
  							  
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">How long does it take to integrate?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">It only takes a matter of minutes to integrate. Once you sign up as a merchant on boxPAY.com, we will provide you with a couple of lines of code. You or your webmaster can copy that into your website, game, or application, and begin billing immediately!</p>
  							  
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">Does boxPAY Integrate with Flash Websites or Games?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">Yes, boxPAY will integrate into Flash developed games or websites. You simply need to add an additional bit of code to the initial Javascript code we provide. Once you sign-up as a merchant, our set-up wizard will walk you through this part of the integration process.</p>
  							  
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">Is the boxPAY widget customizable?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">For top tier clients we offer a white label solution and complete customization.</p>
  							  
  							  
  							  <h4 class="faq-q">Can I test how boxPAY works?</h4>
  							  <p class="faq-a">Absolutely. You can use the Test Simulator in our merchant portal to simulate a live transaction without the cost actually going on your merchant bill. <a href="#">Register</a> as a merchant to access all the benefits of using boxPAY!</p>

  							   <h3>Show me the money! All about finances</h3> 
  							   
  							   <h4 class="faq-q">How are payments handled? How long do I have to wait to get paid?</h4>
  							   <p class="faq-a">Depending on which country you are in, there is an initial waiting period of at least 30 days from the month end of your first transaction before your first payment comes. This is because the phone carriers have to wait until a customer has paid their bill at the end of the month in order to receive their revenue. They then send it to us, and we deliver it to you via PayPal or bank wire transfer. After your initial waiting period, boxPAY makes payments to merchants every 30 days.</p>
  							   	 
  							   	 
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">What currency do I get paid in?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">We track and report your earnings in the local currency of the country the transaction occurred in. Your actual payouts will be in your home currency.</p>
  							   	
  							   	
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">How much does it cost to use boxPAY?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">There is no cost to sign-up for boxPAY and absolutely no maintenance fees for billing on our platform. This is because boxPAY makes money on a revenue share basis after carrier fees. The revenue split is variable depending on country and volume of sales. For specific country payouts please register as a merchant by clicking "Sign Up" in the upper right-hand corner of the screen on <a href="index.php">boxpay.com</a></p>
  							   	
  							   	
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">Are there additional fees?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">No. boxPAY operates on a revenue sharing model as detailed above. There are no additional fees and no unexpected expenses. It costs nothing to get started.</p>
  							   	
  							   	
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">Where can I see how much money I am making?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">We offer access to detailed reporting and analytics as your transactions happen in the <em>Reports</em> section of our merchant portal. Just log into your merchant account, click <em>Reports</em>, and you can see your revenue by country, service, or network. Watch your revenue skyrocket in real time!</p>
  							   	
  							   	
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">What about taxes?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">boxPAY does not withhold any tax from your revenue, however depending on your local VAT or tax laws, you may be required to pay on revenue earned through our platform. This is the sole responsibility of the merchant registered.</p>
  							   	
  							   	
  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">What is boxPAY's policy on chargebacks?</h4>
  							   	<p class="faq-a">Chargebacks for transactions completed by boxPAY are handled in two ways: <br /><br/>
  							   	
	  							   	<strong>1)	Carrier Chargebacks </strong> <br/>
	  							   	
	  							   	If a customer requests a chargeback from their carrier for a charge that was completed using a boxPAY PSMS short code, it is up to the carrier to make a decision whether or not to reverse the transaction. If this happens, the carrier will inform boxPAY and withhold the funds from us. We then direct this cost to the designated merchant and this is reflected on their next 30-day invoice. If carrier chargebacks compose more than 5% of the total invoice, the merchant will be alerted within 5 business days of the carrier informing boxPAY. 	<br/><br/>
	  					
	  								<strong>2)	boxPAY Chargebacks </strong><br/>
	  							   	
	  							    If there is a case where boxPAY has been requested by the carrier or another regulatory body to initiate a chargeback to the end customer, boxPAY will complete this utilizing an online payment delivery service, or in special circumstances, bank wire transfer or prepaid card. The cost of these chargebacks will be reflected in the merchant’s next 30-day invoice. <br/><br/>

	  							    Please note that each chargeback case handled by boxPAY is done so on an individual basis and every effort is made to find the best solution for all parties involved. boxPAY reserves the right to change our chargeback policy pending a 30-day notice period for all merchants.

  							   	<h4 class="faq-q">What would some reasons be for a customer charge not going through?</h4>
  							   	 <p class="faq-a">One of two things happened; either the customer is on a prepaid phone plan and they don’t have the available balance to complete the transaction, or the customer is barred from using premium SMS on a carrier level. </p>
