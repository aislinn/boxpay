  							<p>5.2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, boxPAY agrees to transfer the Specified Proportion of each completed Transaction to You.

  							<p>6.7. To ensure proper payment, You are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with Your account with boxPAY.</p>
